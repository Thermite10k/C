# C Programming Repository

Welcome to my C programming repository! ðŸš€

## About

This repository serves as a space where I practice C programming and share various projects. Whether they're inspired by books I've read or personal ideas, you'll find a mix of interesting code here.

## Contents

- **Projects:** Explore the projects I've (am) worked(ing) on, it's quite empty but more is to come.
- **Book:** I'll occasionally upload code related to the books I'm studying.
- **AdventOfCode:** Now that I've learned the basics of C, it's time to tackle some challenges!

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
