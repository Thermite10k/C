Welcome to my C programming repository! ðŸš€

## About
This repository serves as a space where I practice C programming and share various projects. Whether they're inspired by books I've read or personal ideas, you'll find a mix of interesting code here.

## Contents
- **Projects:** Explore the projects I've worked on, from simple exercises to more complex applications.
